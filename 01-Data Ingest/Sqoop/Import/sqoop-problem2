Problem Scenario 10 : You have been given a database named retail_db with following detail. Which consists 6 tables and datamodel you can see in image.

user=retail_dba 
password=cloudera 
database=retail_db
jdbc URL = jdbc:mysql://quickstart:3306/retail_db

1. Import the entire database in a file format this good for analytical applications on Hadoop 
e.g. group your data in columns and should be able to query this data using Impala.

Also, while importing to save space you do compression using snappy codec.
